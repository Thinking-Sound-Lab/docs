The Canvas is the heart of Invook. It's where your files, notes, conversations, and AI assets come together in **one visible space**. Instead of switching between tools and tabs, you work directly on the Canvas while everything stays connected.

## What Makes Canvas Different?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Everything in One Place" icon="layer-group">
    Files, prompts, AI-generated outputs, and conversations all live together on a shared Canvas.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context preserved" icon="brain">
    Your thinking stays where you left it — no more re-uploading or re-explaining context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaborate in Real Time" icon="users">
    Invite teammates and clients to the same Canvas to review, iterate, and align.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI as First-Class Files" icon="sparkles">
    AI outputs are stored and organized like any other file — not buried in chat logs.
  </Card>

## How to Use the Canvas

Work directly on the Canvas. You can:

- **Connect documents with AI** — attach files to prompts and models to generate assets in context
- **Ask questions about files** — use text tools to query, summarize, or compare content
- **Continue earlier work** — all your nodes and connections are saved, so you never lose progress
- **Collaborate with your team** — leave comments directly on nodes and outputs

<Tip>
  Use the **Add Node** tool to start building workflows. Connect helpers, text tools, and generation models to create custom pipelines.
