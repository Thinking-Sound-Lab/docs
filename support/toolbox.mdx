The Toolbox gives you everything you need to build workflows on the Canvas. Every tool is designed to keep your ideas connected and your process flowing.

## 1. Select

**Precision control for every node.**

Click to select, move, resize, or configure any node on the Canvas. Manage properties, connections, and outputs with complete control.

<Info>
  Use **Select** to inspect the details of any node — including its configuration, connections, and generated outputs.
</Info>

## 2. Pan

**Navigate without limits.**

Click and drag to move freely across your Canvas. Explore large workflows, zoom into details, or step back for the big picture.

---

## 3. Add Node

**Build your workflow, node by node.**

Access the complete library of available nodes and drop them directly onto the Canvas.

### Available Node Types

| Category | Nodes |
|---|---|
| **Helpers** | File, Array, List Select |
| **Text Tools** | Prompt, Concatenator, Any LLM |
| **Generation Models** | [Image Models](/models/image), [Video Models](/models/video) |

<Tip>
  Compose custom pipelines by connecting tools, models, and logic exactly the way you need.
</Tip>

## 4. Assets

**Your built-in Drive.**

Store and organize images, videos, documents, and links — directly inside Invook. Everything stays connected to your Canvas, so you never have to re-upload or lose context.

## 5. Comment

**Collaborate in context.**

Leave feedback directly on nodes and generated outputs — whether it's an image, video, or text result. Review, iterate, and align with teammates and clients without leaving the Canvas.

<Note>
  Comments are attached directly to specific nodes, so feedback always stays in context — not in a separate thread or chat.
</Note>
