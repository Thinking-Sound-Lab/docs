## What is Invook?

Invook is a **shared canvas and drive** where teams generate, organize, and reuse AI-created assets — images, videos, prompts, and workflows — all in one place.

Invook connects AI generation directly to a persistent workspace. Teams can:

- Generate images and videos inside a shared canvas
- Save outputs automatically into a structured drive
- Reuse prompts and workflows across projects
- Collaborate in real time
- Maintain context across projects
