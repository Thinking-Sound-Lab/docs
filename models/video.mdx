## How to Use Video Models

1. Add a **Video Model** node to your Canvas using the [Add Node](/support/toolbox#3-add-node) tool
2. Connect a **File** node (your input image or video) and a **Prompt** node
3. Run the model to generate a new video

</Tip>

<Warning>
  Video generation typically uses significantly more credits than image generation. Check your credit balance before running high-cost models like **Kling o3** (312 credits).
