Invook is designed around the Canvas — a flexible, infinite workspace where all your AI work lives. Here's how to get oriented and work efficiently.

## Working on the Canvas

Work directly on the Canvas. Every tool, model, and asset is accessible from the same space, so you never need to switch windows or re-upload files.

<Tip>
  Use **Pan** (click and drag) to move around large workflows, and pinch or scroll to zoom in and out.
</Tip>

## What You Can Do on the Canvas

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| **Ask questions about files** | Connect a file node to a Prompt node and any LLM model |
| **Summarize content** | Use the Prompt + Any LLM nodes to summarize connected documents |
| **Compare ideas across items** | Build multi-branch workflows connecting different sources to the same model |
| **Continue earlier conversations** | All Canvas state is saved — just reopen your Canvas and pick up where you left off |

## Using Text Tools

Text tools let you craft and chain prompts across your workflow:

- **Prompt** — Write and customize prompts for any connected model
- **Concatenator** — Combine multiple text inputs into one
- **Any LLM** — Route your prompt to any language model for text output

<Note>
  Using text tools like Prompt, Concatenator, and Any LLM consumes credits. See [How Credits Work](/help/faqs) for details.
</Note>

## Navigating Large Canvases

For complex workflows with many nodes:

1. Use **Pan** to scroll freely across the board
2. Use **Select** to click into any node for details
3. Zoom out to see the full workflow at a glance
4. Use the **Assets** panel to find stored files quickly
