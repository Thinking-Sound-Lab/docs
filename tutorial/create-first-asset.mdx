This guide walks you through generating your first asset using the Canvas. You'll connect an input, a prompt, and an AI model to produce a new image or video.

---

## What You'll Need

- An image or file to use as input (optional for some models)
- A description of what you want to generate
- An image or video model selected from the [Image Models](/models/image) or [Video Models](/models/video) list

## Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an Image or File to the Canvas">
    Use the **Add Node** tool to add a **File** node. Upload your image or document directly to the Canvas.

    <Tip>
      You can also use the **Assets** panel to drag existing stored files onto the Canvas.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Prompt Node">
    Use **Add Node** to add a **Prompt** node. Type a description of the output you want to generate.

    **Example:** *"A futuristic cityscape at night with neon lights reflecting on wet pavement."*
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Generation Model">
    Use **Add Node** to add an image or video generation model. For example, **Nano Banana Pro** for image generation.

    Browse all available models:
    - [Image Models](/models/image)
    - [Video Models](/models/video)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Nodes">
    Draw a connection from your **File** node and your **Prompt** node into the **Model** node's inputs.

    The model will use both your input file and your prompt to generate a new asset.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and Review">
    Hit **Run** on the model node. The generated asset will appear as a new output node on the Canvas, stored automatically in your Assets.
  </Step>
</Steps>
